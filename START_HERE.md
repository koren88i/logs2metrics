## For Claude: Read These Files First

1. **STATUS.md** — Current phase, completed work, gotchas, next steps
2. **PLAN.md** — Full roadmap with phase specs and test criteria
3. **ARCHITECTURE.md** — Technical reference: components, domain model, project structure

## Document Roles

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| PLAN.md | Roadmap and specs — what to build, phase-by-phase with test criteria |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | Technical reference — components, domain model, data flow, artifact IDs |
| STATUS.md | Lean handoff context — current state, what's done, what's next, gotchas |

## Prompt

Read `STATUS.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` in this directory. Understand the current phase, what has been built, and what comes next. Confirm you're ready and summarize the current state briefly.
